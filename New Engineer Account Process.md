# Automation

- **Automate account requests**: Mail Merge    

# Remarks

- We should not create accounts before the engineer has started
	- Sharing Personal Info
	- Account and Email Setup is required (InteralIT)
- I don't believe Xurrent is a good way to track the progress. We could create a single ticket, referencing the follow up document. Maybe we can use it for escalations?
